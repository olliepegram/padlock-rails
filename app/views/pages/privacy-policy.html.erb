    <h4>Personal Information</h4>
    <p>You may choose to provide personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) on this Web site. Here are some of the ways you may provide the information and the types of information you may submit. We also tell
        you how we may use the information.</p><br>

    <h4>Contact Us</h4>
    <p>If you email us through the "Contact" link on this site, we ask you for information such as your name and email address so we can respond to your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information as well.</p><br>

    <h4>Email Newsletters</h4>
    <p>If you would like to receive company email newsletters from the Catfish Designs, we ask for your name and email address so we can send you the newsletters.</p><br>

    <p>Questionnaires & Surveys We occasionally may ask visitors to our Web site to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us serve you better and improve the usefulness of our site.
        In conducting these surveys we may ask you for your name and email address. We do not keep any personal information about you in connection with your participation in a ge.com survey unless you specifically agree to provide that information.</p><br>

    <p>Non-Personal Information We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when you visit this Web site. Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single identifiable visitor. It tells us such things as how many users
        visited our site and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our Web site to our visitors. We collect this information either through "cookie" technology or with "web beacons," as explained below.</p><br>

    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p>Like many companies, we use browser cookies on this Web site. Browser cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. We use browser cookies to tell us, for example, whether you've visited
        us before or if you're a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Browser cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.</p><br>
    <p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new browser cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new browser cookie, and how to disable existing browser cookies. Remember though, without browser
        cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our Web site features.</p><br>

    <h4>Information We Share</h4>
    <p>We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about our Web site visitors, except as described here. We may share information provided by our visitors to catfishdesigns.com.au with service providers we have retained to perform services
        on our behalf. These service providers are contractually restricted from using or disclosing the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about
        you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in
        connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.</p><br>

    <p>We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use
        personal information you have provided through this Web site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.</p><br>

    <h4>Links To Other Sites</h4>
    <p>We provide links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. These sites may have their own privacy statements in place, which we recommend you review if you visit any linked Web sites. We are not responsible for the content of linked
        sites or any use of the sites.</p><br>

    <h4>How We Protect Personal Information</h4>
    <p>We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration or destruction of the personal information you provide on this Web site. We use secure socket layer (SSL) technology to help
        keep the personal information you provide on this site secure.</p><br>

    <h4>Updates To Our Privacy Statement</h4>
    <p>This Privacy Statement may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our online information practices. We will post a prominent notice on this Web site to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy
        Statement and indicate at the top of the statement when it was most recently updated.</p><br>
